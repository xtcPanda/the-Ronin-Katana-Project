Write a short paragraph that gives information about your proposed world and justifies the creative decisions you've made for that world.

the Ronin Katana project is a game with an ink art style and only from 3 colors black, white and red mixed in this world in a way that gives the player the feeling of a story wrote in ink on paper with the satisfaction of killing an enemy and the feel of pain and anger

the world is ancient about a samurai got killed with no honor by a king's orders who wanted to take the country from the samurai's master which was a king for the country named "takashi", the samurai is the father of a girl who is still 16 and the last thing she saw before she changes to be our hero was her father getting killed like a criminal.

our story starts with a cutscene with our hero "Rozu" walking in a street with a lot of people dying around here and she is holding her sword's grip like she is waiting for anyone of them to attack her but they disappear when they or she get closer to them... they are the people who she had killed during the time she was preparing her self for this...

the cutscene takes "Rozu" to a door opening which was the castle's door and from here the blood bath begins and ends after the king is killed..

after that another cutscene starts with the emperor giving "Rozu" the title of a samurai but she doesn't agree and says that she is not a samurai and she is a ronin and she asks to die on the same way her father should hv died like a true samurai taking her own life with her own hands. 

this game is a story driven game, the world contains some things the player can interact with like light and walls
the NPCs in this game will be the ninjas "Rozu" will fight and they used to be the king's spies and the king himself was a ninja someday and he took down a kingdom and took over

kusarigama : difficult to use difficult to fight against huge range and if that fails the sikkle was used

tikko-kagi : hand to hand

shuriken and kunai : not to kill but to wound thrown at sequence 

ninja-to sword:

smoke bombs: to escape



they know how to climb walls and cliffs
